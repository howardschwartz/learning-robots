Matlab simulation of robots leaning the pursuer evader game
In this branch of the game, all 4 robots are learning simultaneously. 
Notice how the evader learns how to first follow towards a target and 
then when it gets close to the pursuer #3 it turns to run away, then 
robot #4 learns how to capture it. This is just a template. As a student 
you should look to this as a reference. Many research directions are available.
I continue to develop the program and algorithms but I need lots of help.

Sincerely,
Prof. Schwartz
